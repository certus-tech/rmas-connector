NOTE: We will NOT attempt to create persName beneath person as that is
more complicated. This produces logically the same CERIF model.

if persName with PERSON_ID exists
  update cfOtherNames = OTHER_NAMES
else
  create persName for PERSON_ID with cfOtherNames = OTHER_NAMES

declare variable $OTHER_NAMES external;
declare variable $PERSON_ID external;
