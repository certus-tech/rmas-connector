    <para>Welcome to the home site of the Research Management and Administration System (RMAS) Connector project. RMASConnector is a data integration platform developed under the JISC funded Research
    Management and Administration System project. At the heart of the platform is the Pentaho Open Source Data Integration suite, PDI (also known as Kettle).</para>

    <para>RMASConnector is based on an Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) pattern and is compatible with an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) pattern, in which best practice requires a common message
    structure and vocabulary to ensure interoperability. The RMASConnector project therefore includes the definition of, and support for, suitable message structures. The chosen standard for these
    messages is CERIF, which has been refined and developed as necessary to accommodate RMAS requirements.</para>

    <para>RMASConnector is available as a download from this site. Also available within the download are load-and-go worked examples of platform usage. These examples are designed to be easily
    configurable to work with existing data sources.</para>
